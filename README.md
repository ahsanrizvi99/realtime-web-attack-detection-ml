## 🛡️ Abstract

Web application attacks such as SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) continue to evolve, often bypassing traditional signature-based firewalls. This project presents a **flow-based intrusion detection system** that identifies malicious behavior using statistical network features rather than payload inspection, making it effective even for encrypted traffic.

We evaluate multiple machine learning models using the **CICIDS2017 benchmark dataset**, followed by stress-testing against **custom real-world attack traffic generated using Docker and Kali Linux**. While near-perfect results are achieved on benchmark data, real-world testing exposes generalization challenges, highlighting the importance of continuous retraining and adaptive security pipelines.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Flow-Based Detection**  
  Uses statistical network flow features (packet size, timing, duration) instead of payload inspection.

- **Real-Time Inference**  
  XGBoost model achieves sub-millisecond prediction latency, suitable for live monitoring systems.

- **Explainable AI (SHAP)**  
  Provides feature-level explanations for every prediction, improving transparency and trust.

- **Raw PCAP Support**  
  Direct ingestion of `.pcap` / `.pcapng` files using `pyshark` and CICFlowMeter-style flow extraction.

---

## 🏗️ System Workflow

The end-to-end pipeline from network traffic to classification:

1. **Traffic Capture** — Raw packets captured from victim servers (`.pcap`).
2. **Feature Extraction** — Network flows generated to match training schema.
3. **ML Inference** — Trained model predicts: Normal / SQLi / XSS in real time.

## 📊 Performance Evaluation (CICIDS2017)

Multiple classifiers were evaluated. XGBoost provided the best balance of speed and accuracy.

| Metric | XGBoost (Proposed) | Random Forest | SVM |
|--------|--------------------|---------------|-----|
| **Accuracy** | **99.99%** | 99.92% | 94.50% |
| **Precision** | **99.99%** | 99.94% | 96.80% |
| **Recall** | **99.99%** | 99.92% | 94.50% |
| **Latency (s)** | **0.000049** | 0.042 | 52.12 |

### 🔍 Explainability with SHAP

SHAP analysis revealed that:

- Forward Packet Length  
- Flow Duration  
- Packet Inter-arrival Time  

are the most influential features in detecting attack traffic.

## 🌍 Real-World Validation

To evaluate robustness beyond academic datasets, we generated **live attack traffic using Dockerized vulnerable web servers and Kali Linux attack containers**.

### Key Findings

- Models trained only on CICIDS2017 showed **significant performance degradation** on novel attack patterns.
- Detection rate dropped to approximately **24–30%** on zero-day style simulations.
- This demonstrates **dataset shift** and highlights the risk of relying solely on static benchmark datasets.

### Research Insight

> High benchmark accuracy does not guarantee real-world robustness.  
> Continuous retraining and live traffic feedback loops are essential for production-grade IDS systems.
